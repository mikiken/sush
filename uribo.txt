Hi, I’m Uribo, a wild boar piglet who lives at Kobe University.
I love sweet foods, and my hobby is making sweets.
I also like wearing fashionable outfits, but I keep eating the ingredients while I’m cooking, so I’m trying to diet.
I’m interested in everything, and especially curious about campus life for Kobe University students.
