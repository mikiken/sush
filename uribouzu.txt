Uribouzu loves the sea and boats.
Drawn by the seafaring life, Uribouzu got on a raft, and drifted ashore at the Graduate School of Maritime Sciences, Fukae Campus.
Rescued by Shindai Uribo, Uribouzu now lives in Kobe University as Shindai Uriboâ€™s friend.
(Uribouzu first appeared to make the stamps more lively, another idea from the Student Ambassador team.)
